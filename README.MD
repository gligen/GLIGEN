- Go beyond text prompt with GLIGEN: enable new capabilities on frozen text-to-image generation models to ground on various prompts, including box, keypoints and images.
- GLIGENâ€™s zero-shot performance on COCO and LVIS outperforms that of existing supervised layout-to-image baselines by a large margin.

## Requirements
We provide [dockerfile](env_docker/Dockerfile) to setup environment. 


## Download GLIGEN models

We provide five checkpoints for different use scenarios. All models here are based on SD-V-1.4.

## Inference: Generate images with GLIGEN

We provide one script to generate images using provided checkpoints. First download models and put them in `gligen_checkpoints`. Then run
```bash
python gligen_inference.py
```
Example samples for each checkpoint will be saved in `generation_samples`. One can check `gligen_inference.py` for more details about interface. 


## Training 

### Grounded generation training

One need to first prepare data for different grounding modality conditions. Refer [data](DATA/README.MD) for the data we used for different GLIGEN models. Once data is ready, the following command is used to train GLIGEN. (We support multi-GPUs training)

```bash
python main.py --name=your_experiment_name  --yaml_file=path_to_your_yaml_config
```
The `--yaml_file` is the most important argument and below we will use one example to explain key components so that one can be familiar with our code and know how to customize training on their own grounding modalities. The other args are self-explanatory by their names. The experiment will be saved in `OUTPUT_ROOT/name`

One can refer `configs/flicker_text.yaml` as one example. One can see that there are 5 components defining this yaml: **diffusion**, **model**, **autoencoder**, **text_encoder**, **train_dataset_names** and **grounding_tokenizer_input**. Typecially, **diffusion**, **autoencoder** and **text_encoder** should not be changed as they are defined by Stable Diffusion. One should pay attention to following:

 - Within **model** we add new argument **grounding_tokenizer** which defines a network producing grounding tokens. This network will be instantized in the model. One can refer to `ldm/modules/diffusionmodules/grounding_net_example.py` for more details about defining this network.
 - **grounding_tokenizer_input** will define a network taking in batch data from dataloader and produce input for the grounding_tokenizer. In other words, it is an intermediante class between dataloader and grounding_tokenizer. One can refer `grounding_input/__init__.py` for details about defining this class.
 - **train_dataset_names** should be listing a serial of names of datasets (all datasets will be concatenated internally, thus it is useful to combine datasets for training). Each dataset name should be first registered in `dataset/catalog.py`. We have listed all dataset we used; if one needs to train GLIGEN on their own modality dataset, please don't forget first list its name there. 


### Grounded inpainting training

GLIGEN also supports inpainting training. The following command can be used:
```bash
python main.py --name=your_experiment_name  --yaml_file=path_to_your_yaml_config --inpaint_mode=True  --ckpt=path_to_an_adapted_model
```
Typecially, we first train GLIGEN on generation task (e.g., text grounded generation) and this model has 4 channels for input conv (latent space of Stable Diffusion), then we modify the saved checkpoint to 9 channels with addition 5 channels initilized with 0. This continue training can lead to faster convergence and better results. path_to_an_adapted_model refers to this modified checkpoint, `convert_ckpt.py` can be used for modifying checkpoint. **NOTE:** yaml file is the same for generation and inpainting training, one only need to change `--inpaint_mode`

## Disclaimer

The original GLIGEN was partly implemented and trained during an internship at Microsoft. This repo re-implements GLIGEN in PyTorch with university GPUs after the internship. Despite the minor implementation differences, this repo aims to reproduce the results and observations in the paper for research purposes.
